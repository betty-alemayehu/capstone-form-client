# üìò Form: Your Path to Mastering Movement

## üìñ Overview

**Form** is a gamified health education app designed to make learning and mastering physical movements enjoyable and interactive. Inspired by apps like Duolingo and CodeSignal, it offers a progressive "tree path" of poses and activities across disciplines like yoga, calisthenics, and dance. Users can learn poses, upload personal achievements, and track their progress visually. With integrated features for AI-powered posture feedback, **Form** helps users grow from beginner to expert in their chosen disciplines.

## üöß Problem Space

Learning and mastering physical movements, such as yoga poses, dance techniques, or calisthenics exercises, can be challenging for individuals at all levels. This app addresses several key pain points:

1. **Entry Barriers for Beginners**:  
   Starting a new discipline can be intimidating without clear guidance, structured progress, or beginner-friendly tools. Many feel overwhelmed by the steep learning curve.

2. **Cost of Entry**:  
   Committing to formal classes‚Äîwhether for yoga, dance, or other disciplines‚Äîcan be prohibitively expensive, especially for beginners who only want to try a few moves or explore multiple styles at once.

3. **Lack of Progress Visibility**:  
   Tracking improvement in physical skills is often abstract and subjective, making it difficult for users to recognize their growth and stay motivated.

4. **Inconsistent Practice**:  
   Building a habit of regular practice is tough without external motivators like streak tracking, visual progress, or accountability tools.

5. **Alignment and Form Issues**:  
   Without feedback, users risk improper technique, which can hinder progress and lead to frustration or even injury.

By addressing these challenges, **Form** empowers users to explore movement affordably, overcome barriers, track their progress visually, and build consistent habits while mastering physical skills.
